# Java Practice Projects

This repository contains my Java practice projects and learning exercises.  
I use it to improve my understanding of core Java, object-oriented programming, and backend development concepts.

## Purpose
- Practice Java syntax and core language features
- Apply object-oriented programming principles
- Work with relational databases using JDBC
- Learn and apply common backend patterns such as DAO
- Build small but realistic backend-style projects

## Projects

### Library Management System (JDBC + DAO)
Path: `JDBC_DAO/Library_v1.0`

A backend Java application that simulates a simple library system.

Key features:
- CRUD operations for books and authors
- JDBC integration with PostgreSQL
- DAO pattern for data access abstraction
- SQL queries for data persistence
- Clear separation of concerns (MVC-style structure)

Tech stack:
- Java
- JDBC
- PostgreSQL
- SQL
- DAO Pattern

### Java Classes Practice
Path: `classes-practice`

A collection of small Java exercises focused on:
- Classes and objects
- Constructors and methods
- Basic OOP concepts
- Java syntax and logic practice

## Tools and Technologies
- Java
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Git and GitHub
- PostgreSQL
- JDBC

## Notes
This repository is used for continuous learning and experimentation.  
New projects and improvements are added as I continue developing my Java backend skills.
